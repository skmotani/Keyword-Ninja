You are an SEO, data-modeling, and classification expert.

I already have an AI-generated **Client Master** JSON profile for this client.
It is currently used by existing code and pages, so:

⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

- Do NOT delete or rename any existing top-level fields.
- Do NOT change the meaning of any existing keys.
- You are allowed to:
  - append new fields,
  - add new nested objects,
  - or fill in currently empty/null values.
- Your output must be a **superset** of the existing `clientMaster`, not a replacement.
- Do NOT hard-code any final classification labels (like "PRODUCT SERVICE", etc.).
  You must only provide **patterns, keyword lists, and descriptive rules** that my program
  will use later for domain, URL, and keyword classification.

========================================
INPUT YOU WILL RECEIVE
========================================

You will receive a JSON object called `clientMaster`, which is the CURRENT profile
for this client, plus some plain-text context such as:

- business_overview
- primary_domains
- other_domains
- products_services
- industries_segments
- customer_types
- example_keywords

Some of this information may already be inside `clientMaster`, some may be new.

Your job is to:

1. Carefully READ the existing `clientMaster`.
2. Preserve all existing fields and values.
3. Extend it with additional, classification-focused sections and fields described below.

========================================
YOUR OUTPUT
========================================

Return ONLY a single JSON object, also called `clientMaster`, that:

- Contains everything that was in the input `clientMaster` (unchanged).
- Additionally contains or completes the following sections, adding them if missing:

1) clientMaster.meta
2) clientMaster.coreIdentity
3) clientMaster.domains
4) clientMaster.urlClassificationSupport
5) clientMaster.keywordClassificationSupport
6) clientMaster.businessRelevanceSupport

If any of these sections already exist, MERGE and ENRICH them instead of replacing
them blindly.

Below is the required structure and purpose of each section.

----------------------------------------
1) meta
----------------------------------------

If `meta` already exists, keep its fields and add missing ones.

Fields to ensure:

- "clientName": string
- "generatedAt": ISO datetime as string (approximate is fine, e.g. "2025-12-08T00:00:00Z")
- "industryTag": short snake_case tag for the main industry
  (e.g. "textile_machinery_oem", "online_education", "saas_crm")
- "summary": 2–3 sentence human-readable explanation of what this client does and for whom.

----------------------------------------
2) coreIdentity
----------------------------------------

If `coreIdentity` exists, extend it. Otherwise create it.

Fields to ensure:

- "businessModel": short description of how the client makes money
  (e.g. "B2B OEM textile machinery manufacturer and exporter").
- "primaryOfferTypes": array of main offer types
  (e.g. ["machines", "equipment", "online_courses", "software_saas", "consulting_services"]).
- "productLines": array of strings describing major product families.
- "services": array of strings (if applicable).
- "industriesServed": array of strings describing industries / applications.
- "customerSegments": array of strings describing the types of customers.

These fields are for context and future UI. Do not remove existing identity fields.

----------------------------------------
3) domains
----------------------------------------

If `domains` exists, extend it. Otherwise create it.

Purpose: help the system decide whether a DOMAIN is relevant or irrelevant.

Fields to ensure:

- "primaryDomains": array of canonical domains for this client.
- "secondaryDomains": array of other official domains (country domains, microsites, etc.).
- "expectedTlds": array of TLDs that are common and acceptable (e.g. [".com", ".in", ".de"]).
- "positiveDomainHints": array of lower-case words/phrases that, if appearing in a domain,
  suggest it belongs to this industry or niche.
- "negativeDomainHints": array of lower-case words/phrases that usually mean the domain
  is NOT relevant to this client’s business (e.g. "movie", "music", "game", "crypto",
  "ai_productivity", "fashion_blog" etc., adapted to this client).

Later, my code will use these to classify competitor domains. You are NOT classifying
domains now; you are only providing hints/patterns.

----------------------------------------
4) urlClassificationSupport
----------------------------------------

If `urlClassificationSupport` exists, extend it. Otherwise create it.

Purpose: provide per-client URL path PATTERNS that my program can use to infer URL type
(product, category, blog, support, legal, account, etc.) WITHOUT hard-coding
per-client logic inside the code.

Each field has:

- "description": human explanation
- "examples": array of simple lower-case strings used as slug/path fragments

Fields to ensure:

- "productSlugPatterns"
- "categorySlugPatterns"
- "blogSlugPatterns"
- "resourceSlugPatterns"
- "supportSlugPatterns"
- "legalSlugPatterns"
- "accountSlugPatterns"
- "careersSlugPatterns"
- "aboutCompanySlugPatterns"
- "marketingLandingPatterns"

For example, for a textile machinery OEM, "productSlugPatterns.examples" might include:
["twister", "winder", "heat-setting", "tfo", "cabler", "filament-yarn", "spun-yarn"]

These are NOT final labels; they are clues my later code will use to assign Page Types.

----------------------------------------
5) keywordClassificationSupport
----------------------------------------

If `keywordClassificationSupport` exists, extend it. Otherwise create it.

Purpose: provide per-client PHRASES and TOPICS that help classify keyword intent.

Fields to ensure:

- "brandKeywords": {
    "description": "...",
    "examples": [ ... brand and near-brand phrases ... ]
  }

- "transactionalPhrases": {
    "description": "...",
    "examples": [ ... phrases that indicate buying/quote/price intent ... ]
  }

- "commercialResearchPhrases": {
    "description": "...",
    "examples": [ ... phrases that indicate comparison/review intent ... ]
  }

- "informationalPhrases": {
    "description": "...",
    "examples": [ ... phrases that indicate educational intent ... ]
  }

- "directoryPhrases": {
    "description": "...",
    "examples": [ ... phrases like 'manufacturers in', 'suppliers in', 'list of', 'directory' ... ]
  }

- "irrelevantKeywordTopics": {
    "description": "...",
    "examples": [ ... themes that share words but are the wrong context for this client ... ]
  }

These will be used later to classify keywords per client. You are NOT classifying
sample keywords here; you are building reusable pattern lists.

----------------------------------------
6) businessRelevanceSupport
----------------------------------------

If `businessRelevanceSupport` exists, extend it. Otherwise create it.

Purpose: describe how to think about "relevance" for domains/URLs/keywords.

Fields to ensure:

- "directCompetitorDefinition": short paragraph on what a direct competitor looks like.
- "potentialCustomerDefinition": short paragraph on what a likely customer looks like.
- "marketplaceDefinition": short paragraph on which marketplaces/channels are relevant.
- "irrelevantDefinition": short paragraph giving examples of obviously irrelevant content,
  even if some words appear similar.

These descriptions will help humans and may feed into future AI prompts.

========================================
GENERAL RULES
========================================

- Do NOT remove or rename any existing keys in clientMaster.
- When adding arrays, provide concrete examples (no "..." placeholders).
- Use lower-case strings for pattern examples where possible.
- Do NOT output any comments or explanations outside of the JSON.
- Your final answer must be ONLY the updated clientMaster JSON object.
