Goal:
Strengthen the URL evaluation and page classification logic so that:
- Far fewer pages end up as "OTHER MISC".
- Homepages are handled explicitly and meaningfully.
- Rules make full use of the enriched Client Master (including urlClassificationSupport).
- No classification is hard-coded for a specific client; everything is driven by the Client Master patterns.

Current context:
- We already store per-page fields such as: domain, location, page URL, keyword, estimated traffic/value, etc.
- We already have derived columns such as: Page Type, Page Intent, SEO Relevant, SEO Action, Confidence, Method.
- Page Type is chosen from a fixed enum (must not change):
  - PRODUCT SERVICE
  - CATEGORY COLLECTION
  - BLOG ARTICLE NEWS
  - RESOURCE GUIDE DOC
  - PRICING PLANS
  - LANDING CAMPAIGN
  - COMPANY ABOUT
  - SUPPORT CONTACT
  - CAREERS HR
  - LEGAL POLICY
  - ACCOUNT AUTH
  - OTHER MISC
- We now have an enriched Client Master JSON per client, which includes:
  - domains: positive/negative domain hints, etc.
  - urlClassificationSupport: productSlugPatterns, categorySlugPatterns, blogSlugPatterns, resourceSlugPatterns, supportSlugPatterns, legalSlugPatterns, accountSlugPatterns, careersSlugPatterns, aboutCompanySlugPatterns, marketingLandingPatterns.
  - keywordClassificationSupport and businessRelevanceSupport for later.

What I want you to design and implement:

1) Centralize URL classification logic
- Identify or create a central function/module responsible for classifying a single page record based on:
  - URL (including parsed pathname and slug segments)
  - Keyword (optional)
  - Optional page title/snippet, if available
  - The current client’s Client Master (especially urlClassificationSupport)
- This function should return at least:
  - pageType (one of the existing enum values)
  - pageIntent (using our current intent categories)
  - isSeoRelevant (boolean)
  - classificationConfidence (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  - classificationMethod (initially "RULE"; later we can add "AI")

2) Enforce a clear rule order to reduce OTHER MISC
Update the classification rules so they run in this priority order:

a. Utility / structural pages:
   - If the URL path contains any patterns from:
     - accountSlugPatterns → Page Type = ACCOUNT AUTH
     - legalSlugPatterns   → Page Type = LEGAL POLICY
     - careersSlugPatterns → Page Type = CAREERS HR
     - supportSlugPatterns → Page Type = SUPPORT CONTACT
   - These should be SEO Relevant = false (for content strategy) and Confidence = HIGH.

b. Homepage and basic company pages:
   - Detect the homepage (root URL: no extra path after the domain).
   - Also detect “about/company/story/team” style URLs using aboutCompanySlugPatterns.
   - For these, set:
     - Page Type = COMPANY ABOUT
     - Page Intent = NAVIGATIONAL
     - SEO Relevant = true
     - SEO Action = MONITOR_ONLY (or equivalent)
     - Confidence = HIGH.

c. Product / service pages:
   - Use folder-level hints (e.g. path segments like "product", "products", "machine", "machines", "equipment", "services") **plus**
     urlClassificationSupport.productSlugPatterns from the Client Master.
   - If any productSlugPatterns appear in the path/slug, and the page is not already classified in (a) or (b):
     - Page Type = PRODUCT SERVICE
     - SEO Relevant = true
     - Confidence = HIGH.

d. Category / industry / application hubs:
   - Use folder-level hints (e.g. "industry", "industries", "applications", "solutions", "segments", "markets", "use-cases", "product-category")
     **plus** urlClassificationSupport.categorySlugPatterns.
   - If any match, and the page not already classified:
     - Page Type = CATEGORY COLLECTION
     - SEO Relevant = true
     - Confidence = HIGH.

e. Blog / article / news content:
   - Use folder and slug hints (e.g. "blog", "news", "articles", "insights", "resources", "stories")
     **plus** urlClassificationSupport.blogSlugPatterns.
   - If any match:
     - Page Type = BLOG ARTICLE NEWS
     - SEO Relevant = true
     - Confidence = HIGH.

f. Resource / guide / document pages:
   - Use urlClassificationSupport.resourceSlugPatterns and simple checks like:
     - URL ends with ".pdf"
     - slug contains "manual", "whitepaper", "datasheet", "brochure", "guide", "technical-document"
   - If match:
     - Page Type = RESOURCE GUIDE DOC
     - SEO Relevant = true
     - Confidence = MEDIUM or HIGH depending on clarity.

g. Pricing / landing pages (if supported in current logic):
   - Reuse any existing rules for PRICING PLANS and LANDING CAMPAIGN.
   - Optionally, allow urlClassificationSupport.marketingLandingPatterns to improve detection.

h. Fallback:
   - If none of the above rules match:
     - Page Type = OTHER MISC
     - SEO Relevant = false by default (or use existing behavior)
     - Confidence = LOW.
   - This bucket should become much smaller after implementing the earlier rules.

3) Make full use of Client Master without hard-coding per-client rules
- Load the current client’s Client Master JSON for each classification run.
- Treat urlClassificationSupport.* arrays as inputs to the generic logic, not as one-off conditions.
- Do NOT write any logic that checks for specific brands or product names in code; rely on Client Master patterns instead.
- The same code should work for any client by simply changing their Client Master.

4) Keep everything backwards-compatible
- Do not rename or remove any existing Page Type values or derived columns.
- If some pages were already classified, either:
  - Recompute them using the new rules, or
  - Only apply the new rules to rows that are missing classification or currently OTHER MISC, depending on existing behavior.
- Make sure the UI continues to work with the existing dropdown options.

5) Add or refine explanatory tooltips for URL-based classification (optional but recommended)
- For the Page Type column header, ensure the tooltip clearly explains:
  - Why Page Type exists,
  - How URL + Client Master patterns are used,
  - How this helps with SEO (product vs category vs blog vs support, etc.).
- Similarly, ensure Page Intent, SEO Relevant, SEO Action, Confidence, and Method columns have detailed tooltips so that a user can understand the purpose without reading the code.

6) Implementation notes
- Avoid hard-coded file names and keep the logic modular so it can be reused in API routes, batch jobs, or UI-driven recalculation.
- Design the classifier so it can be called per-row with (pageData, clientMaster) as inputs and return a consistent classification object.
- Ensure that if Client Master is missing a given pattern array, the code safely falls back to an empty array (no crashes).

Deliverables:
- Updated classification logic module(s) implementing the rule order above and using Client Master urlClassificationSupport patterns.
- Any necessary wiring to load Client Master and pass it into the classifier.
- Updated or confirmed column tooltips for Page Type and related fields.
