We already started building a keyword API data page, but I want to make the behavior and UI more precise. Please UPDATE the implementation as follows.

Context:
- We have:
  - Client Master (with clientCode)
  - Keyword Manual Master (`manualKeywords.json`)
  - API Credential Master (`api_credentials.json`) with `serviceType` including 'SEO_DATA'
- We have started implementing:
  - `KeywordApiDataRecord` in `lib/keywordApiStore.ts`
  - JSON file `data/keyword_api_data.json`
  - Page `/keywords/api-data`
  - API route for fetching keyword data from a stubbed provider

Now please refine and enforce this behavior:

1) API Credential lookup

In the API route that refreshes keyword data (e.g. `POST /api/seo/keywords/fetch`):

- Before calling the stubbed provider, read the API credentials from `api_credentials.json` using the existing ApiCredential store / helper.
- Find an active credential where `serviceType === 'SEO_DATA'`:
  - If none found:
    - Return an error response (e.g. `status: 400`) with a JSON message like: `"No active SEO_DATA credential configured."`
    - The frontend should show this error clearly to the user.
  - For now, we do NOT need to use the real API key, but the lookup must be implemented correctly because later we will connect it to DataForSEO.
- Keep using the stubbed `fetchKeywordDataFromProvider` for now.

2) Keyword source and refresh logic

- When Refresh is triggered for a given `clientCode` and `locationCode`:
  - Load active manual keywords for that client from `manualKeywords.json` (filter by `clientCode` & `isActive = true`).
  - If there are no keywords, return a clear message and the frontend should show: “No active manual keywords found for this client.”
  - Normalize the keywords (trim, collapse spaces, lowercase for `normalizedKeyword`).
  - Call `fetchKeywordDataFromProvider(keywords, locationCode)` to get mock keyword metrics.
  - DELETE / REPLACE behavior:
    - For `keyword_api_data.json`, remove any existing records where:
      - `clientCode` = selected client, AND
      - `locationCode` = selected location.
    - Insert the new `KeywordApiDataRecord` rows.
  - For each new record, set:
    - `id` = uuid
    - `lastPulledAt` = current ISO datetime
    - `snapshotDate` = current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - `sourceApi` = 'DATAFORSEO'

3) UI for `/keywords/api-data`

Update `/keywords/api-data` page to behave as follows:

- At the top:
  - Dropdown to select **Client** (show name + code).
  - Dropdown or radio to select **LocationCode** (start with "IN" and "GL").
  - Button: **“Refresh keyword data from API (overwrite old)”**.
- When the button is clicked:
  - Call the `POST /api/seo/keywords/fetch` endpoint with `clientCode` and `locationCode`.
  - While the request is in progress, disable the button and show a small “Refreshing…” indicator.
  - On success:
    - Show a green success notification at the top of the page, e.g.:  
      “✅ Keyword data refreshed for [ClientName] ([LocationCode]) at [HH:MM, DD MMM YYYY].”
    - Reload the table data and summary.
  - On error:
    - Show a red error notification with the error message, e.g. missing SEO_DATA credential, missing manual keywords, etc.

- Below controls, show a **Summary Box** for the selected client + location:
  - Client name & code
  - Location code
  - “Last refreshed at:” using the latest `lastPulledAt` from `keyword_api_data.json` for that client+location (via helper `getLastPulledAtForClientAndLocation` or equivalent).
  - Total keywords in table for this client+location
  - Count where `searchVolume > 0`
  - Average `competitionIndex` (ignore rows with null/undefined)

4) Compact table layout

Update the keyword data table on `/keywords/api-data` to be very compact so many columns are visible:

- Use Tailwind classes like:
  - `text-xs` for font size
  - `py-1` or even `py-0.5` for table cells
  - `px-2` for horizontal padding
  - `leading-tight` for text
- Wrap the table in a div with `overflow-x-auto` so it can scroll horizontally.
- Use a sticky header row with `sticky top-0` and a subtle background.
- Columns to show:
  - Serial number (computed from array index + 1)
  - keywordText
  - searchVolume
  - cpc
  - competitionIndex
  - locationCode
  - sourceApi
  - lastPulledAt
- Ensure all these columns are visible, even if the user has to scroll horizontally.

5) Read-only nature of Keyword_API_Data

- The table on `/keywords/api-data` must be **read-only**:
  - No edit / delete buttons on individual rows.
  - The only way to update this data is via the **Refresh keyword data from API** button, which overwrites all rows for that client+location.

6) General

- Keep everything in TypeScript.
- Keep data-access helpers in `lib/keywordApiStore.ts` and `lib/apiCredentialsStore.ts` (or similar).
- Make sure the app still builds and runs on Replit.

At the end, please list which files you changed for:
- the API route,
- the keyword API store,
- the API credentials store,
- and the `/keywords/api-data` page.
