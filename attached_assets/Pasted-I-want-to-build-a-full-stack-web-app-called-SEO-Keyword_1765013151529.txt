I want to build a full-stack web app called **“SEO Keyword Intelligence Platform”**.

Use:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

For v1, please implement:

1) Layout & Navigation
- A top navigation bar with links:
  - Home (`/`)
  - Clients (`/clients`)
  - Competitors (`/competitors`)
  - Keyword Manual (`/keywords/manual`)
- Use a simple, clean Tailwind layout with a centered container and page title on every page.

2) Client Master (CRUD)
- Page: `/clients`
- Data model `Client`:
  - `id` (string or auto id)
  - `code` (string like `01`, `02`)
  - `name` (string)
  - `mainDomain` (string)
  - `notes` (optional string)
  - `isActive` (boolean; if false, treat as archived / deleted)
- On `/clients`:
  - Show a table of all clients with columns: Code, Name, Main Domain, Active?, Actions.
  - Provide a form to add a new client.
  - For each row, allow:
    - Edit (update fields)
    - Archive / Unarchive (toggle `isActive` instead of hard delete).

3) Competitor Master (CRUD)
- Page: `/competitors`
- Data model `Competitor`:
  - `id`
  - `clientCode` (or clientId reference)
  - `name`
  - `domain`
  - `notes` (optional)
  - `isActive` (boolean)
- On `/competitors`:
  - Show a table listing competitors and which client they belong to.
  - Provide a form to add a competitor (choose client from a dropdown using the Client Master).
  - Allow Edit and Archive / Unarchive per row.

4) Keyword Manual Master (CRUD)
- Page: `/keywords/manual`
- Data model `ManualKeyword`:
  - `id`
  - `clientCode` (or clientId)
  - `keywordText` (string)
  - `notes` (optional string – e.g. “from client interview”)
  - `isActive` (boolean)
- On `/keywords/manual`:
  - Show a table with columns: Client, Keyword, Notes, Active?, Actions.
  - Provide a form to add a new manual keyword:
    - select Client (dropdown from Client Master)
    - enter keywordText
    - optional notes
  - Allow Edit and Archive / Unarchive per keyword.

5) Storage (very important)
- For now, do NOT use an external database.
- Instead, use JSON files in a `data/` folder as a simple “mock database”, for example:
  - `data/clients.json`
  - `data/competitors.json`
  - `data/manualKeywords.json`
- Implement a small data-access layer (helper functions) that:
  - reads from these JSON files
  - writes updates back to them
- This way, the data is persistent inside the Replit project and can be downloaded or migrated later.

6) Code style
- Use TypeScript everywhere.
- Keep components and data-access code in separate files where it makes sense.
- Make sure the app runs with the default Replit run command.

After generating the project, please list which files you created or modified.
