We look for keywords containing your specific brand terms (e.g., \"Meera\", \"Meera Industries\") and compare the total search volume.\n\n**SEO Advantage (Why this matters):**\n1. **Brand Health Check:** A high brand search volume means people know and trust your name. It's the ultimate measure of \"off-page\" SEO and real-world reputation.\n2. **Navigation Intent:** Users searching your name WANT to find you. Ensure you rank #1 for these terms to capture 100% of this high-intent traffic.\n3. **Competitor Benchmarking:** See if competitors are growing their brand awareness faster than you.",
