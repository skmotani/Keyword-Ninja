    "explanationSummary": "SERP pages from this domain are product detail pages for yarn twisting and winding machines (e.g., Double/Single Deck Spun TFO, Industrial Thread Twister, Cheese Assembly Winder), matching the client's core product lines. The content and terminology indicate an equipment manufacturer offering specifications and features, so the domain type is OEM/Product Provider. These pages aim to drive enquiries for specific machines, indicating a transactional intent. Because the offerings closely overlap Meera’s core twisting and winding machines, the product match is high and the domain is classified as a direct competitor.",

    "explanationSummary": "The client is a B2B OEM for yarn twisting, winding, and heat-setting machines, while amyoxford.com sells hand-dyed rug yarn to craft/hobby users. The SERP URL is a retail collection page for “Rug Yarn,” indicating consumer e-commerce rather than industrial machinery or mill operations. This aligns with the profile’s negativeTopics (DIY crafts/consumer textiles), so the product match is 0.00 (None). Consequently, the domain is classified as Irrelevant Industry with Irrelevant Intent and overall Irrelevant business relevance.",

    "explanationSummary": "SERP pages from this domain are retail category/product pages for hobby weaving supplies (e.g., rug weaving yarns, bobbin/cone winders like Leclerc), which aligns with the client's negativeTopics around handloom hobby content and consumer equipment. The intent is clearly transactional (shopping pages offering multiple options to buy). These offerings are not industrial yarn twisting/winding/heat-setting machines for mills, so product match is 0.00 (None). Therefore, this domain is irrelevant for Meera Industries despite term overlap like “cone winder.”",

The domain clearly functions as a B2B directory/marketplace, matching the client’s marketplace indicators. Because these pages list suppliers and products rather than sell as an OEM, the dominant intent is Directory/Listing, yet topical alignment is high.
